TreadWise Tire Co.

TreadWise is a tire company built for today's drivers and fleets. Our mission is to make road travel safer and greener by pairing premium tires with mobile service and sensor‑driven analytics that extend tire life and reduce waste.

We sell and install tires wherever it's most convenient—at your home, workplace, or depot—often the same day. For commercial clients, our Smart Tread™ platform uses IoT pressure and temperature sensors plus predictive analytics to spot issues early, cutting downtime and fuel costs. We also operate a circular program that prioritizes retreading, refurbishment, and certified recycling.

The founding team blends deep tire engineering, IoT, and operations experience:
- Maya Patel, CEO: a former senior tire design engineer who led major safety programs.
- Luis Romero, CTO: a telematics veteran who scaled a 100k‑device sensor network.
- Jenna Brooks, COO: operations leader with 15 years improving national service networks.
- Dr. Koji Tanaka, Head of Sustainability: materials scientist specializing in rubber recycling and low‑rolling‑resistance compounds.

Why TreadWise? We deliver a clear edge: the Smart Tread™ analytics suite, fast mobile installs, transparent membership pricing, and a closed‑loop sustainability model. The result is fewer blowouts, longer tire life, and a smaller footprint—keeping customers confidently on the road.
